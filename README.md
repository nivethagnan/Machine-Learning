# Machine-Learning

## Introduction
### The increase of energy consumption has been at an all time high in recent years. Although the demand for energy has been increasing, the limit of resources has become a major concern for most households. With high demand and limited resources, there has been a surge in electricity prices making it critical to develop new techniques to reduce energy consumption and cost savings on electricity bills

## Objective
### The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using the KNN algorithm based on the electric power consumption dataset mentioned prior. This model strives to identify patterns and various effective techniques for the general households to reduce their electric billing. One key strategist for a household to reduce their billing cost is to reduce their energy consumption. Through analyzing the dataset, this model will be trained to investigate the relationship between energy consumption and factors of the certain appliances used in general households.
